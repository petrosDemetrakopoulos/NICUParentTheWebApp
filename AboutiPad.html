                <p class="paragraph_style_1">   This application is dedicated to the staff of the NICU at Iaso maternity hospital, Athens, Greece and in the memory memorial of Anna Vasiliadou (neonatologist of Iaso’s NICU).<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">   In April 1997, immediately  after my birth I had to be hospitalized in this unit for about a month and it is now clear to me, from the discussions with my parents and doctors that I have met during the subsequent years, that without the immediately intervention, the assistance and the excellent scientific support of the staff of the whole the unit, certainly I couldn't be in a position to develop applications for mobile phones today.  <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">   From the stories of those who lived the events that followed my birth closely, I know that the neonatologist Anna Vasiliadou was mostly the one who believed, not only in my survival but also in my ability to overcome any problems and have a perfectly normal life. Her belief filled my parents with a lot of courage at that very difficult time for them, so her role was very important.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"> I would also like to thank on this occasion the gynecologist who watched my mother and who also happens to be an excellent family friend Mr Mixalis Apallakis, because he acted timely and drastically and because without his intervention and personal involvement, the whole outcome of the events associated with my birth, might have been completely different. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"> I am now 15 years old, old enough to understand that I owe a lot to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the IASO maternity hospital and this application is my own way to thank them all for what they did for me.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"> Finally I would like to give my special thanks to Dr D. Constantinou, Director of IASO’s NICU, for his valuable contribution in the editing and the correction of the texts of this application.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>
