                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style">  Prematurity effectively means immaturity. In a premature infant, the body's systems are not fully developed, and the more premature it is, the less developed are the organic systems. The respiratory system is not functioning fully, the brain may not be ready to control the breath, an immature nervous system may hinder the breastfeeding process, the digestive system is  also immature and makes it difficult to feed the baby. The baby may also develop jaundice, hypoglycemia (not enough glucose in the blood) and hypothermia (inability to maintain body temperature because there is not</span><span style="line-height: 18px; " class="style_1"></span><div style="height: 96px; width: 168px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 96px; position: relative; width: 168px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Premies_files/droppedImage_1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 97px; width: 168px; " /></div><span style="line-height: 18px; " class="style_1"></span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style"> enough insulating fatty tissue).  Premature babies are also more vulnerable to infections than those born in time, due to immaturity of their immune system.<br /></span></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style"> One of the most common problems that premature infants face is respiratory distress. A newborn baby that will be led in NICU due to respiratory distress, it is not sure that it will be intubated and put on life support. Depending on the severity of its condition, it might be under  simple observation or be under diffused oxygen in the incubator or it might have two small tubes at its nose that would administer oxygen. If the difficulty that it faces with breathing is severe, it might be connected for a few days with a ventilator .<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style"> The improvement comes gradually. The increased experience of neonatologists and the high technology NICU equipment that exists in most NICUs today, will help the baby to overcome difficulties. The next step is that the baby will start to be fed with a syringe at the beginning, then with  a bottle and finally it will be able to breastfeed without getting tired and without breathing with difficulty.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style">    Infants weighting less than 2300-2500 gr, are led to neonatal unit, no matter if they have good breathing or not in order all their activity to be monitored and to start feeding under supervision. Do not forget that these infants, losing the first days normally about 10% of birth weight, they will exit the hospital weighing less than their birth weight i.e. 2100-2200 gr. This is not an obstacle for them to leave the hospital, as long as they are bottle-fed without difficulty.<br /></span></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style">   The situation gets more complicated and difficult when the birth weight is lower.

So a baby that is born with a weight between 1500-2000 gr and after having overcome the respiratory problem, it is common to stay in the NICU between 15 and 40 days. Babies with birth weight between 1200-1500 gr, typically stay more than 2 months in the NICU and infants weighing less than 1000 grams will stay in the unit for more than 3 months.<br /></span></div>

The advanced medical procedures in the NICU allow physicians to manage these conditions in many preterm infants and deal quite effectively with their problems. Many NICUs now apply specific developmental care protocols for premature  babies involving the simulation of the womb’s environment.

                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style">    Because of rapid advances in the treatment of premature babies in the modern NICUs, 90% of infants with birth weight greater than 800 grams will live but careful control and continuous monitoring is needed for them until their body systems are mature enough in order to operate independently. In addition to gestational age, there are other factors that contribute to a better prognosis, such as gender for example - girls are more likely to survive than boys.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style">    Despite early difficulties, it is important to know that two-thirds of the premature babies either continue their life and are developed normally or will experience mild problems. If a premature baby does not face a serious complication, such as a severe brain hemorrhage, the prospect for the development of normal mental and motor skills is excellent; but parents should remember to evaluate the development of their baby based on the corrected age.<br /></span></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style"> Premature babies have two ages, one is chronological and the other one is developmental / corrected/ adjusted, as it is often called.  Chronological age (CH) is a term that is used to indicate the age from the actual day the child was born. The Corrected a</span><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2"></span><div style="height: 100px; width: 143px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 100px; position: relative; width: 143px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_1"><img src="Premies_files/droppedImage_5.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 100px; width: 143px; " /></div><span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2"></span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style">ge (CA) otherwise known as Gestationally Corrected Age (GCA) or sometimes just Gestational Age (GA) is based on the age the child would be if the pregnancy had actually gone to term. To find your baby's corrected age, subtract the number of weeks or months early he was born from his current age. So, if a baby is 6 months old, but was born two months early, his adjusted age is 4 months, if your baby is 14 weeks old but he was born 6 weeks early, subtract 6 from 14 to and the result 8 weeks is the development / corrected/ adjusted age of your child. Use this developmental / corrected age when you compare your child with other children. For most children the chronological and developmental age coincide by the age of 2 and this adjustment is not needed any more. For some children however,such as the very young preterm babies, that might still run behind in some skills, it is good to continue using the corrected age for a longer period.<br /></span></div>

                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style">  The chances for long-term complications are relatively smaller after 28 weeks of gestation. But every premature baby should be examined at regular intervals by specialists. During the examination-which is known as follow up- physical growth, neurologic status, psychomotor development, vision and hearing of the child are assessed. So any problems arising from premature birth are detected on time and successfully treated and appropriate instructions are given to the parents.<br /></span></p>

And this is not because the neonatologists do not want to be committed to a specific date, but because every day the situation of the newborn might change, sometimes rapidly and not necessarily for the worse, as parents might believe and fear! As the days are passing and neonatologists have a more complete picture and can be more clear about possible duration of hospitalization period .<br /></span></p>

There's excellent equipment, exceptional training of neonatologists and other staff and above all there is real medical altruism. There are now cases of infants weighing 550 gr. that return home in a very good health. Only if you think about this you will be able to understand the feat performed by NICU’s staff who really overcome themselves for the newborns that they hospitalized.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style"> -Parents who have a preterm newborn in NICU should be armed with patience, have a positive psychology and trust neonatologist who will inform them.
