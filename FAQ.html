                <p class="paragraph_style_1">To protect your baby from infections and in order to create a proper environment for premature babies in NICU (conditions without too much light and noise, without many unnecessary manipulations of the infant etc.), all NICUs apply a visiting schedule, usually  2 times a day. Mothers who are breastfeeding or feeding their baby with a bottle, can visit NICU more often.  <br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1"><div style="height: 107px; width: 160px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 107px; margin: 2px 2px 2px 0px; position: relative; width: 160px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="FAQ_files/droppedImage.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 107px; width: 161px; " /></div><span style="line-height: 14px; " class="style"></span><span style="line-height: 14px; " class="style"></span><span class="style_1">Can I bring friends or relatives to visit my baby in NICU? </span> <span class="style_1"><br /></span></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Usually it is not possible for other family members except mother and father to enter NICU. This measure is a basic requirement to infection control because premature babies are particularly susceptible to infections.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">What precautions should parents get before entering NICU and during their stay there?<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1"><div style="height: 132px; width: 149px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 132px; margin: 2px 0px 2px 2px; position: relative; width: 149px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="FAQ_files/droppedImage_1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 133px; width: 149px; " /></div><span style="line-height: 14px; " class="style"></span><span style="line-height: 14px; " class="style"></span>Before getting into the unit to visit their baby, parents should wash their hands thoroughly with an antiseptic, in the space provided at the entrance of NICU and wear a special apron. During the entrance in NICU parents should be careful not to touch with their hands nowhere and to use their elbows if necessary  to touch or open something like a door. <br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Going close  to their baby, if it is in an incubator, they must try not to touch the incubator with the hands. When the baby is somewhat stabilized, they will be given the opportunity, prior arrangements with the staff, to touch it slowly on arms or legs. In this case, it is recommended to wash their hands again on the child’s closest sink.   <br /></p>

This time increases gradually as the baby is stabilized and passes from intensive to intermediate care and finally to simple observation. But you should always have in mind that NICU is a place where emergency incidents and medical priorities may alter or reduce the time of your visit.</span><span class="style_2"><br /></span></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Can I take part in the care of my baby when it is in NICU?<br /></p>

This cooperation is the base for a successful outcome. At first you may be allowed, due to the your baby’s condition, to sit just next to it, to talk to it and touch it. As your baby is getting better , it will be stabilized and it will gain weight, so you will gradually allowed, and always in collaboration with the NICU’s staff, to hold it, to change the diaper and feed it.   </span><span class="style_2"><br /></span></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Can I breastfeed my baby while it is in NICU?<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1">In modern NICUs, mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their babies and the staff helps as much as it can toward this direction. There are studies that show that babies who breastfeed have less possibilities for infections, tend to have fewer problems from prematurity and generally exit NICU earlier. When mothers intend to breastfeed but the baby is not ready yet, they can take out the breast milk with a pump and create a milk bank, that will be granted to their baby as soon as it is able to be fed with milk. In many NICUs early pacifier suckling is encouraged <div style="height: 106px; width: 141px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 106px; margin: 6px 6px 6px 0px; position: relative; width: 141px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="FAQ_files/droppedImage_4.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 106px; width: 142px; " /></div>to facilitate the consolidation of the suckling reflex.<br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">The kangaroo method can also help to maintain and increase the breast milk production, so that when the baby is ready to breastfeed, this to be done without further complications.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">How long will my baby be hospitalized in NICU? When can I take it home?<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1">This is the most common and the most difficult question to be answered to parents. The process of health improvement and<div style="height: 180px; width: 160px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 180px; margin: 4px 0px 4px 4px; position: relative; width: 160px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_4 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="FAQ_files/droppedImage_5.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 181px; width: 160px; " /></div> recovery, differs from baby to baby and depends on many parameters like the gestational age , the problems presented, the findings of the examinations, any infections that may affect the baby and others. Each baby that is hospitalized in the NICU, is a special case, this is why it gets individual care. <br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"> The neonatologists take into consideration a large number of factors before deciding that an infant is ready to go home. To be feasible and safe for your baby to leave the NICU, the following requirements should exist:<br /></p>
