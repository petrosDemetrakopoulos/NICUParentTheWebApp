                <p class="paragraph_style_5">Nurses on the NICU bear the main daily care of a baby in intensive care and often become good angels for parents who have many questions and are very concerned about the status of their baby.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_5"> Here are just some of the tasks contained in the daily list of a nurse at NICU. Babies, even the tiniest of them, need regular changes, feeding and cuddling. Usually,  the nurse will go through every baby at regular intervals throughout the day and night time (usually every 3 or 4 hours) and every time she will change the baby’s diaper, she will take baby’s temperature and she will feed it. If a newborn is taking medicines, they can also be administered by the nurse. <br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_6">    <span class="style_3">  </span><div style="height: 180px; width: 269px;  height: 180px; position: relative; width: 269px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Staff_files/droppedImage_2.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 180px; width: 270px; " /></div><span class="style_3">  <br /></span></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Each nurse in NICU is specialized and is constantly trained to be ready for any drug use in neonates, for the insertion and the change of intravenous lines, for being able to check the proper functioning of ventilators, incubators and the rest of the complex technical equipment of NICU. She is also able to administer shots and blood transfusions when needed and generally she has all the knowledge and skills necessary for the immediate care of the tiny patients. <br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_2">    The nurses of NICU often have an important role in supporting the parents of the baby at a time when they are very worried and anxious. When possible, parents and sometimes<span class="style_4"></span><div style="height: 129px; width: 194px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 129px; margin: 2px 2px 2px 0px; position: relative; width: 194px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Staff_files/droppedImage_3.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 129px; width: 195px; " /></div><span class="style_4"></span> other family members are invited to take an active role in child care.  Nurses can teach parents how to take care of their infants  properly and according to the babies’ needs and they are watching them as they learn. Usually are those who feel the greatest satisfaction when seeing some of the smallest or sickest babies to stabilize, grow and eventually go home with their family.<br /></div>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_2"> In NICU you can also find a range of other specialists for infants (pediatric cardiologist, ophthalmologist, ENT, pediatric neurologist, etc.) which act as consultants. Their help might also  be asked by the neonatologist in order to treat more effectively the problems of the newborns.  </p>
