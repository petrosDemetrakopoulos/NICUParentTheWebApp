                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">When parents enter the NICU for the first time, the equipment and the complex machines that exist there cause a great impression to them .<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"> These machines are NICU’s tools to cover the diversity and special needs of premature and sick babies.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"> In order to become an active partner in the care of your baby in NICU, it is helpful to know a little about these tools, so below you can find a brief description of the equipment that helps and supports the four basic needs that the babies have to cover in order to survive outside the womb: the warmth, breathing, nutrition and blood flow.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <span class="style">Open incubators:<br /></span></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1"><div style="height: 117px; width: 176px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 117px; margin: 2px 2px 2px 0px; position: relative; width: 176px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Equipment_files/droppedImage.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 117px; width: 176px; " /></div><span class="style_1">Infants who have trouble maintaining their temperature and thus their body warm, are usually placed in one of these special beds that help to maintain the right temperature at the body of the baby. A sensor placed in the abdomen or the chest of the baby, monitors the body temperature and gives signal to the electronic part of the incubator to increase or decrease the heat that it sends to the baby. The open incubators, are commonly used for babies who need more care and continuous interventions by the staff.  </span><br /></div>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1"> <span class="style">Closed incubators:</span><div style="height: 125px; width: 160px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 125px; margin: 2px 0px 2px 2px; position: relative; width: 160px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Equipment_files/droppedImage_1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 125px; width: 161px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style">An incubator of this type, uses liquefied air to keep the baby warm. Since premature babies can lose moisture from their body easily,through their thin skin, water is added to the air to prevent this. As it happens in open incubator as well , a sensor is mounted on the belly of the baby and adjusts the amount of heat provided to the baby. Because it is closed, this incubator also protects the baby from bacteria and noise. The nurses, doctors and parents have access to the baby through special openings.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">Vital functions recording monitor</span> :  <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">It is a device, that via several sensors monitor the vital signs of your baby at regular intervals and displays the results on a screen.<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style"><div style="height: 112px; width: 150px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 112px; margin: 2px 2px 2px 0px; position: relative; width: 150px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Equipment_files/droppedImage_2.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 112px; width: 150px; " /></div>The nurses and doctors check these screens to monitor the infant’s vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, etc. The sensors are usually placed on the chest of the baby. These are small painless stickers connected to wires. Blood pressure is measured with a small armband placed around the leg or the arm of the baby. The screens can be grouped into one big unit near the bed of your baby. Measurements can also be transferred to remote screens, close to places where nurses stand.  <span class="style_2"><br /></span></div>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1"><div style="height: 112px; width: 158px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 112px; margin: 2px 0px 2px 2px; position: relative; width: 158px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Equipment_files/droppedImage_3.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 112px; width: 159px; " /></div><span class="style_1">An oximetry machine (or pulse oximeter) may also transfer information about oxygen level in baby’s blood on the screen. It is also a painless device and its sensor looks like a small bandage mounted around the fingers of the hand or the toes of your baby and emits a soft red light. It gives doctors information about how well the lungs and the heart of your baby are functioning. </span><span style="line-height: 18px; " class="style_3"><br /></span></div>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_2">Feeding tubes:<span class="style_1"></span><div style="height: 114px; width: 149px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 114px; margin: 2px 2px 2px 0px; position: relative; width: 149px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Equipment_files/droppedImage_4.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 115px; width: 149px; " /></div><span class="style_1"><br /></span></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Often, babies who are in NICU are not able to get the calories they need through feeding by bottle, so the staff must use small feeding tubes to give the baby breast or other milk. The tube is placed in the baby’s stomach through mouth or nose. It is called nasogastric catheter.  <span class="style_1"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span class="style_1"> </span><span class="style_4">Even if an infant is able to take some milk from the bottle, the NICU’s staff may choose to give all the nutrition to the baby through a feeding tube, so that the baby do not waste valuable energy trying to suckle from the bottle.   <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style">Infusion pumps and intravenous catheters:<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style"> </span><span class="style_1">These devices provide fluids, nutrients and medications that your baby may need. They provide the exact amount of the substance with the right rate and within the time that meets the unique needs of your baby.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style_1"> An intravenous catheter (or IV) is a thin, flexible tube inserted into the vein with a small needle. When the catheter is placed in a vein, the needle is removed, leaving only the soft plastic tube. Almost all babies that are hospitalized in the NICU have catheters for fluids and medications - usually on the hands or the feet, but even on the head.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style_1"> Although the image of your baby, connected with so many tubes can discourage you, you should keep in mind that instead of injecting your baby every few hours, doctors have chosen to provide what your baby needs through these infusion sets. </span><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style_1">      <div style="height: 179px; width: 268px;  height: 179px; position: relative; width: 268px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Equipment_files/droppedImage_5.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 179px; width: 269px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Doctors can use these devices to provide medications that help the heart function, the blood pressure or relieve pain.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Respirators: <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"> Babies who are in NICU, often need help to breathe well. Infants in this case are connected with a ventilator (or breathing machine) via endotracheal tube (a plastic tube placed in the trachea through mouth or nose). There are many different types of respirators - different situations require different machines- but they all accomplish the same purpose: to help a baby to breathe. <span class="style"> </span><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4">Phototherapy bulbs:<span class="style_5"><br /></span></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style">Often, premature and full-term infants develop jaundice (jaundi<div style="height: 106px; width: 159px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 106px; margin: 2px 0px 2px 2px; position: relative; width: 159px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Equipment_files/droppedImage_6.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 107px; width: 159px; " /></div>ce is a common condition in newborns in which the skin and the whites of the eyes turn yellow). Phototherapy is used to  help the baby to get rid of the bilirubin that causes jaundice. Infants can lie on a special treatment unit with light or to have light bulbs affiliated with the incubator. Usually, they need phototherapy for a few days. <br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style"> The baby’s eyes should be covered when it is under this light, but the light is not harmful. The eyes are covered  so that babies are not disturbed by the light. <br /></p>
