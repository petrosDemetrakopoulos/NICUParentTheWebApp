This method     creates  a very<span class="style"></span><div style="height: 171px; width: 139px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 171px; margin: 2px 2px 2px 0px; position: relative; width: 139px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="kangarooMethod_files/droppedImage.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 171px; width: 140px; " /></div><span class="style"></span> pleasant environment for the baby, since except from the warmth provided by the physical contact with its mother, it hears her voice and the beat of her heart. <br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_1">Kangaroo method started in 1979 in Columbia, where as there weren’t enough incubators for all the premature babies, mothers were keeping them naked on their breasts to warm them. Doctors noticed that many babies who received this type of care , were lactating easier (being all the time in their mother’s breast), were healthier, were gaining weight faster, had fewer problems with feeding and were leaving the hospital faster than those that were hospitalized in incubators.</span><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style"> Today many NICUs practice this method successfully and encourage mothers of premature babies to participate. The process is simple and it can last from half to four hours a day. It is sufficient that the mother is seated in a reclining chair, holding her baby dressed only in a diaper naked in her chest, covered with a soft blanket. <span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2"></span><div style="height: 119px; width: 159px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 119px; margin: 2px 0px 2px 2px; position: relative; width: 159px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block stroke_0"><img src="kangarooMethod_files/droppedImage_1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 120px; width: 159px; " /></div><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">The benefits for both the mother and the infant are numerous. The baby calms down , stops crying, is breathing  in a more regular pace  minimizing the cases of apnea, increases its weight faster and through physical contact its temperature is linked with that of its mother. The hug of the mother and the baby’s contact with the skin, can help it to recover faster, to breastfeed earlier  and to have more adequate development. The bond between the mother and the child is strengthened and the emotional world of the mother stimulates, at a time when she needs it most, since stress, anxiety and fears are following her and many times trap her in thoughts  that lead to negativity and pessimism. <br /></span></div>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">The method of “kangaroo-mother”, as it is called differently, concerns infants born before 35 weeks of gestation and weight less than 1800 grams , but certainly those whose health condition is stable and are able to come out of the incubator for a short time. There is no minimum weight  for a baby to start kangaroo method, but premature infants that weight less than 1500 grams, must be connected to a  temperature monitoring system, while they are outside of the incubator. </span><div style="height: 105px; width: 158px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 105px; margin: 2px 2px 2px 0px; position: relative; width: 158px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="kangarooMethod_files/droppedImage_2.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 106px; width: 158px; " /></div><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_2">      <br /></span></div>
